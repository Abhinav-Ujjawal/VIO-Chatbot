# 🗣️VIO-Chatbot

### ❓About
<p>
  This project uses Python and Open AI to create a <b>Voice Input-Output</b> chatbot [thus, the name].<br><br>
  This is an attempt to create a chatbot similar to Jarvis(Yes, the one from Avengers), though, as one may expect, 
  the performance of this model is dependent on the performance of the API provided by OpenAI and the voice recognition function of the device on which it is run.

### ❗Requirement
<p>
  Before starting the chatbot, don't forget to replace the dummy key with your OpenAI key at line 7.
